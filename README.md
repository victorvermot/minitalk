<h1>Introduction</h1> <a name="introduction"></a>
Minitalk is a project developped by myself in ecole 42. The project was developed in C and it was done in about a week. The project introduces sorting unix signals and their usages. The projects also helps teaching basics bitwise operations.

# Goals 
The goal of the project was to create two different programs, simulating a server and a client.
- The server waits for instruction from the client.
- The client sends instructions in the form of a string and the server must print it.
- We were only able to use SIGURS1 and SIGURS2 to send messages between programs.

# Bitwise <a name="bitwise"></a>
Bitwise is the making of operations on a byte level.
To perform those operations, you can use the followings operators:

# Bitwise Operators <a name="operators"></a>
- **&** (AND): Compare two bytes: 1 and 1 = 1, the rest = 0
